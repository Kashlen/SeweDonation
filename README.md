# SewnDonation:  reservation system for sewn donations

This project was created to facilitate the exchange of information between organizations that distribute sewn donations and organizations that receive these donations.  In addition, it provides information to hobby seamstresses who sew these gifts themselves so that they know what the greatest demand is at these organizations (typically maternity hospitals and non-profit organizations).  

In this case, sewn gifts are mainly **clothes for premature babies**, which are not very available and at the same time they are not even materially demanding. Women who sew at home usually have many fabric leftovers after sewing of larger pieces and they like to sew and donate pieces which are really needed for little babies. The problem usually is the limited information about what is actually needed. From time to time, there are discussions on it in Facebook sewing groups. The purpose of this application is thus to ease this exchange of information among all involved parties.

## How the application provides information exchange
In the application, we can find reservation system where are data about stored items. For organisation accepting donations, it is possible to create an account and create a reservation for all needed items. It is possible to reserve also items which are not stored. In this case, when there are more needed items than it is actually stored, the most needed items will show in the main page (accessible without login). So once any seamstress decides to sew a gift for any of these little babies she can just have a quick look instead of time-consuming finding information among people.
